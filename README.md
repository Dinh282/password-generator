# Password-Generator-in-JavaScript

## Description

In this project, I was given a starter code to edit. The code contains an index.html file that is linked to a style.css and script.js file. Im tasked with finishing the script.js file to make the app fully functional. By completing this project, I was able to understanding how JavaScript is like the engine of a webpage. In this project, without javascript the password generator is just an empty shell. You would have a nice webpage of a password generator, but when the user clicks on the button to generate a password, they will not get anything until JavaScript code is written.
